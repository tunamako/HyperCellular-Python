Cells:
	Bounded by euclidean circles

	Represent by a QRegion
		- Construct by subtracting/ANDing/XORing regions of boundary circles
	 
	 Have cells be a QButton to make clicks constant time complexity

Construction:
	Start with center polygon
	Reflect vertices about each of the sides
	Construct arcs for these new polygons (two points determine a line in hyperbolic space)
	Repeat in a breadth-first pattern until specified layers have been drawn
