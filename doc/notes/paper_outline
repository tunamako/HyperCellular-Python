Why did I choose the project?

Hyperbolic Geometry
	- define lines
	- define polygons
	- briefly mention differnent models and why I chose the poincare model

Regular Tilings
	- describe them in euclidean geometry
	- describe in hyperbolic
		- schlaffi notation
		- valid vs invalid schlaffi numbers

Algorithms for construction
	- describe hyperbolic reflection
	- different possibilities for construction
		- compass and straightedge
		- reflection (the one i chose)
		- reflection + rotation
	- coordinatization difficulties (briefly, save group theory for the end)

Implementation
	- class diagram
	- interaction of controller/viewmodel
	- extensibility and support for other models (klein)
	- describe pcviewmodel, tile, edge and their responsibilities
	- image of ui + description of interactivity

Cellular Automata
	- Basic description and concepts
		- briefly mention them in square grids
		- neighborhoods
	- Class diagram and interaction with the rest of the program
	- extensibility and inheritance to support any CA

Conclusion
	- issues
		- coordinitization
		- much more difficult than i anticipated overall
			- half the semester was spent on constructing the tiling
		- too much possibility for retreading ground
	- hopes
		- use group theory + knuth-bendix completion
		- use opengl for more optimized rendering
